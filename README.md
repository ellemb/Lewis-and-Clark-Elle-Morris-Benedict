# Analyzing Historical Text in Python: Sentiments Towards Native Americans Exhibited in the Lewis and Clark Expedition Journals
## Elle Morris-Benedict
## Abstract:
  Non-indigenous news, films, museums and literature have demonstrated a warped perspective on Indigenous American history in order to preserve a sense of nationalism. This narrative results in nationwide ignorance of Native American experiences. As a result, non-Natives feel more comfortable with the United States’s history and Natives feel the residual effects of colonialism by being considered relics of the past rather than ever-changing communities that have adapted and resisted their hardships over time. I plan to use Python code to conduct a case study on a historical text which demonstrates the dehumanization and erasure of Native American experiences and history.
  Historical texts illustrate sentiments of the time period the piece was written in, and I want to analyze the impact widely read historical texts have on the public opinion of Native Americans. Every author carries their own bias, and every bias is influenced by historical context. For instance, at what point in time did the majority of academic literature shift from referring to the Indigenous peoples of America as “Indians” to variations of “Native” or “Indigenous” Americans? This question led me into a rabbit hole of texts and articles ranging from Columbus’s misclassification of the Taino people as “Indians” in 1492, to modern day debates amongst (mostly non-indigenous) academics over what Indigenous people want to be called. I decided to narrow down my topic. I opted to analyze one, very influential time period when the relationship between the federal government and Native tribes from the northeast was already shaky, but most Western Natives had yet to lay eyes on colonists. From 1482-1776, the Native Americans on the Eastern side of North America were brutally massacred and colonized by British, Spanish, and French settlers and explorers (Native American History Timeline, 2023.) Once the United States declared independence, the colonization of Natives expanded faster than states could form. Dreams of Manifest Destiny and civilizing “savage Indians” ran excitedly through the new country. While colonial settlers already had a racist image of what Native Americans were, most of the Western American Tribes had no idea what the “white man” was, or the destruction he was capable of. 
  So, what historical text could illustrate the sentiment of the general public towards Native Americans in the formative years of the U.S.? While this question still produced various sufficient options, the Lewis and Clark journals from 1804-1806 struck me as the most significant. The value in this text for my question is that the authors can illustrate the sentiments of the broader U.S. government. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark served in the U.S. army together before Clark retired and Lewis became Jefferson’s personal secretary. Both men had experience working for the federal government, meaning they were employed within imperialist frameworks, and likely shared many of the values and goals of the Commander (and POTUS) who sent them on the voyage. The expedition was launched by President Thomas Jefferson in a time where the colonial ideals of Manifest Destiny guided government agendas. The goal of the expedition was to establish trade with Native American tribes, and explore the West further after obtaining new land in the 1803 Louisiana purchase. (Lewis & Clark among the Indians 1. The Voyage Begins | Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, n.d.) When Jefferson ordered the expedition, he asked Lewis because he knew various Native languages, and Lewis suggested Clark as an additional leader of the voyage.
  The questions I seek to answer in my case study include: what sentiment did the Lewis and Clark journals project towards Native Americans? Did they fuel or diminish the already existing white superiority complex that engulfed white Americans at the time? Were Natives referred to more as the specific tribe they were from, “Natives” or “Indians”? In what language and tone was Sacagawea discussed? I will use the text analysis tools we practiced in class to extract all sentences from the journals that reference “osage,” “crow,” “mandan,” “blackfoot,” “flathead,” “shoshone,” “sacagawea,” “native,” or “indian.” I will then analyze these sentences and what they showcase about the relationship between the federal U.S. government and Indigenous American tribes at that time. I will look into the most common words that accompany any of the above references to Natives, the number of times each term is used, and at what point in the journal entries, if any, can a shift in terminology be observed.
  Impactful events of the late 1800s and early 1900s in regards to the Native tribes in the American West include the Wounded Knee massacre, the studying of Ishi, boarding schools, and the Indian Relocation Act. When the U.S. finally fulfilled its “manifest destiny” and stretched from the East to West coast, past treaties with Indigenous tribes began to lack power in the government's eyes. Treaties were responsible for establishing that tribes are distinct political institutions, and this shift in ideology once California achieved statehood in 1850 created the perception that tribes are subordinate dependent nations to the United States, meaning no need for treaties. I want to explore the relationship between Western tribes and the US government before the traumatic events the colonial government forced upon them. While violent colonialism had been running its course through the Eastern tribes since 1492, many of the Western nations met white men for the first time during the 1804 Lewis and Clark expedition. The aim of my project is to illustrate how Lewis and Clark perceived their interactions and relationships with Native Americans via their personal documentation of their two year journey.
  Analysis of the attitudes of Native Americans in the early years of the United States is greatly aided by the journals of the Lewis and Clark expedition. They offer a rare glimpse into the  interactions between the federal government and Native American tribes during a period when the nation was still establishing its supremacy over Native populations. We can learn more about how the words used in the journals reflect the prevailing cultural sentiments against Native Americans at the time by carefully examining the journals. Therefore, we can better understand how falsified cultural narratives have been maintained. My project's goal is to bring attention to the ways that historical documents such as the journals kept by Lewis and Clark have aided in the erasing and dehumanization of Native American experiences.
